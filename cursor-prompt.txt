I need help managing my dev environment for "The Book of Kubernetes" (bok).

## Project Layout

- Book examples live at: /Users/jonchin/bok/examples-jc/
- Chapters are in directories like chapter-01, chapter-02, ... chapter-20
- Chapter numbers are zero-padded to two digits (e.g., chapter-02, not chapter-2)

## Python Virtual Environment

Before running any ansible commands, you MUST activate the Python venv:

    source /Users/jonchin/ansible_venv/bin/activate

## Setup Workflow

When I tell you which chapter I'm on (e.g., "chapter 2", "ch 5", etc.):

1. cd into /Users/jonchin/bok/examples-jc/chapter-<zero-padded number>
2. Read the README.md in that chapter directory to understand which commands to run
3. Run the playbooks in this order:
   a) ansible-playbook aws-setup.yaml
   b) ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
   c) ansible-playbook extra.yaml  (only if the file exists in that chapter directory)

Some chapters (like chapter-08 and chapter-12) have subdirectories with separate setups — check the README to understand the structure.

## Running the Playbooks

- Each command can take a long time (several minutes). The aws-setup.yaml playbook in particular can take 5+ minutes because it waits for EC2 instances to boot and fetches SSH host keys with retries.
- Run each command in the background (block_until_ms: 0) and poll the terminal output file to monitor progress.
- A successful completion looks like this in the output:

    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    localhost                  : ok=16   changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=7    rescued=0    ignored=0

  The key indicator is failed=0. The host could be "localhost" or an IP address.
- Wait for each playbook to finish successfully before starting the next one.
- Always use required_permissions: ["all"] when running ansible-playbook commands, since they need full filesystem and network access.

## Teardown

When I say "I'm done", "teardown", "tear down", "im down", or something similar, run:

    source /Users/jonchin/ansible_venv/bin/activate && ansible-playbook aws-teardown.yaml

Run this from the same chapter directory. This terminates the AWS EC2 instances.

## SSH Access

After setup is complete, I can SSH into the instance with:

    ./aws-ssh.sh host01
    sudo su -

The aws-ssh.sh script is generated during aws-setup.yaml and lives in the chapter directory.

## Important Notes

- Always activate the venv before every ansible-playbook command (each shell invocation is independent).
- The ansible warnings about collection version compatibility are harmless and can be ignored.
- If aws-setup.yaml fails on the "fetch host keys" step, it's usually a timing issue — just re-run it.
- After all playbooks succeed, print a summary showing which playbooks ran, their results, and the SSH connection info.
